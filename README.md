# Deep-Learning

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing MRI scan images of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease using deep learning techniques. The dataset comprises MRI images categorized based on disease progression, enabling automated classification and diagnosis. The model leverages simple and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify patterns indicative of Alzheimer's, aiding in early detection and research.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for the study contains images of MRI scans form patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's which are separated into four classes namely:
0: Mild Demented
1: Moderate Demented
2: Non-Demented
3: Very Mild Demented.

## Methodology
Two basic neural networks i.e Simple Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network  was first conducted and an improved version of the neural network was later then created. Using only the optimized convolutional neural network created, a learning rate of 0.000000001 vs a learning rate of 10 was tested  using SGD optimizer.The advantages and disadvantages of higher and lower batch was also discussed.
